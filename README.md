>This project is a real-time DoS attack detection system.

>It uses a model based on logistic regression, selected after testing several popular classification models. The dataset used is [DDoS Attack Network Logs.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacobvs/ddos-attack-network-logs)

>Network details for your IP are fetched using Scapy and passed as parameters to the trained model (.pkl file). However, the model requires further tuning as its real-time performance is not yet satisfactory.

>Despite this, the model performs well in offline evaluations.
